summary: "Bill Hader intended to be a director - Did *SNL* get him there?"

#Before *The Hottest Club in New York* 

With eight years an *SNL* cast member under his belt and a long list of comedy credits, Bill Hader remains one of the most popular alumni of the show in recent years. 

While other cast members ambitiously sought out auditions (Jimmy Fallon once stated [GET EXACT QUOTE] that if he wasn't on the show by the age of 25, he'd quit], Hader characterizes his as a surprising turn of events. 

Living in Los Angeles and making a salary as a production assistant, Hader wanted to pursue directing and tried making a short film to little success. Seeking a creative outlet, he ended up taking classes at Second City and formed a sketch group with class members to perform around Los Angeles. One group member was the brother of actor Nick Offerman (of *Parks and Rec* fame) and it was Offerman who brought the show to the attention of his wife, Megan Mullally.

 “Going from Second City L.A. to ‘S.N.L.’ was like going from preschool straight to Harvard,” he said. “It made me feel, ‘The whole nation will see that I’m a fraud!’ ” [^#]

#Leaving *SNL*

Hader left *SNL* in 2013 and immediately found that while the show had granted him a significant degree of fame, it was as a performer rather than a creative. Agents and producers pushed him to focus on his comedy roots, even suggesting a film based on his *SNL* character of Stefon (co-created with former writer John Mulaney). 

He attended table readings (cite New Yorker article here -- paraphrase) and while early projects did involve fellow *SNL* alumni, research on his career trajectory reveals a greater reliance on people he met within comedy that were willing to take him outside of television and outside of sketch performances. 


#Analysis

In our study of the *SNL* Coefficient, we've created a chart of Hader-affiliated projects by start year. Some are incongruous with  Hader's timeline as television projects are listed by year of premiere rather than the year Hader appeared. For example, *Curb Your Enthusiasm* is listed as a project in 2000 while Hader's 2021 appearance on the show was after he departed *SNL*. 

Visually, two observations are immediately clear.

1) Qualifying media between 2010 and 2020 are overwhelmingly *SNL* specials or awards ceremonies. 
2) While Hader's career involves a great degree of collaboration, those relationships have not produced *SNL* media.

##*SNL* as a stepping stone 

Hader currently stars on Barry, when asked in an interview what role he'd be on the show talked about working in the crew (find quote)

Megan Mullally wasn't an SNL alum, but through a career in television and in comedy, knew Lorne Michaels. Michaels was then able to offer an audition and pulled Hader out of obscurity. (Hader later took the role of talent agent on with Pete Davidson, who he recommended for an audition after (whatever movie he did with Pete Davidson).) 

Alec Berg and Bill Hader met at a premiere and began collaborating on Barry. 

Hader has assisted on projects led by other *SNL* alumni, with appearances in Inside Out, etc., but overall his personal projects have relied on his contacts in the industry outside of his cast mates. 

He contributes the only data in *GENRES* to the coefficient, although the project doesn't have a coefficient of more than one. 

Hader's data is a story of how *SNL* is a launchpad, but also a potential constraint.
