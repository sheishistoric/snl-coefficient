*I was fired, I was fired*
*NBC said that I was done*
*Then I made over $4 billion at the box office*
*So I guess you could say I won*
- Adam Sandler, *SNL* Monologue, May 4, 2019 [^1]

24 years after his (involuntary) departure from *Saturday Night Live*, Adam Sandler (1990-1995) returned as a first-time host to the show in 2019.[^2] 

When discussing the *SNL* coefficient, Sandler was one of the first actors that we brought up for analysis. 

While Sandler left the show unceremoniously, he is arguably one of the most successful cast alumni as a massive film star with his own production company, Happy Madison Productions. 

Since 1995, he has collaborated with several of his *SNL* costars, meriting a quantitative *Variety* article on the subject.[^3]. Written in 2013, *Variety's* article lists former cast member Rob Schneider and former *SNL* writer Tim Herlihy among his most frequent film collaborators. 

Based on our data, we developed a chart to further quantify Sandler's reputation for "hiring his friends" to fill out casting in his productions.

CAPTION: On the y-axis, see *SNL* alums who have collaborated with Sandler during and after his time on the show. On the x-axis, view how many projects each contributor has been involved in. Project titles are also visible via color-coding.

At present, 15 Sandler-involved projects have an *SNL* coefficient of at least 1.

* One project is a widely-accepted *SNL* media: *Coneheads* (1993) with a coefficient of 8.7 and 18 current or former *SNL* castmembers 
* 7 films with co-efficients of at least one are produced by Happy Madison Productions
* For Happy Madison Productions, Sandler's most frequent collaborator is Rob Schneider (1998-1994) with 21 productions.
* For all projects, Sandler's most frequent collaborator is Chris Rock (1990-1993)
* Sandler has 9 projects with coefficients above 0.8 and less than 1, with a possibility of moving into the category of *SNL* media if the coefficients of individual cast members increase by hosting *SNL*, returning to the show as writers or cast members, or receiving *Best Of* features

As shown on our chart, Sandler's films since 1990 have shown a steady rate of collaboration with actors and writers he met on *SNL* or through similar comedy networks. 

His early qualifying projects are not starring roles (*Coneheads* (1993) is based on a sketch that premiered long before Sandler was on *SNL* and *Dirty Work* (1998) starred the late *SNL* legend Norm MacDonald). 

This was followed by a steady production of low-coefficient films with 2-6 *SNL* cast members including *I Now Pronounce You Chuck And Larry* (2007).

Following the success of *Grown Ups* (2010), there is a rapid increase in heavy collaboration with other ensemble films.

*Grown Ups*, which featured 11 former *SNL* writers or actors including four in starring roles (David Spade (1989-1996), Sandler, Schneider, and Rock), became Sandler's then-highest-grossing film worldwide with a gross of $271.4 million.[^4] The sequel, another box office success, premiered in 2013 with 19 *SNL* alumni in the credits.
 
In the next decade, Sandler was involved in 12 films with *SNL* coefficients above 1. In fact, Sandler had a qualifying project for 8 years in a row from 2010 to 2017 (*Hotel Transylvania 3* (2018) did not have as high a coefficient as its two predecessors). 

Potential *SNL* media expanded greatly in the 2010s, with significant credit to Sandler's production company and ensemble-focused comedy projects. While his last qualifying film, *Hubie Halloween* (2020) came out two years ago, Sandler continues to build his comedy networks from *SNL*. 

In recent talks with *Variety*, Sandler suggested that he may return as a host, potentially boosting past projects above the minimum coefficient. [^5]. Current cast members are also slated to appear in his upcoming projects with Sarah Sherman (2021-present) in *You Are SO Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah!* (2023). 

Sandler's departure from *SNL* under less than ideal conditions did not prevent him from building a career in the comedy world. In fact, his time on the show permitted a great number of his films to exist in the way they do today.
