summary: "How has SNL facilitated connections amongst community?"

One of the key aspects of our definition of an *SNL* film was that alumni worked on a project together. For me, that's one of the more interesting aspects of looking at *SNL* as a franchise. We can certainly talk about the box-office or *star* power *SNL*, but few of those successes are necessarily the result of *SNL* in the long-term. What makes Happy Madison Productions films *SNL* movies (at least by my line of thought) is not that Adam Sandler is involved, but that numerous *SNL* alumni - who met because of the show - continue to work together decades after their time in the cast. *30 Rock* has *SNL* DNA not just from Tina Fey's real-life experiences, but also because of the numerous cameos and casting decisions (not to mention the direct involvement of Lorne Michaels and Broadway Video.)

Looking at the cohorts over time, we see that the 2010s feature the largest number of definitive SNL media.

Famously, the Amy Poehler/Tina Fey collaboration  

## Basic Network Analysis
Using Melanie Walsh's *Introduction to Cultural Analytics and Python*[^1], I created some quick visualizations to make sense of collaborations amongst *SNL* alumni.

### Basic Network
(This network removes *Saturday Night Live* from the dataset, as that would connect everyone in the network.)
Lorne Michaels really is at the center of it all, with 215 connections in the network. This is followed by Fred Armisen, Amy Poehler, Tina Fey, and Bill Hader. I

## The Paula Pell Factor: How Collaboration Affects Careers

"Paula's like the basketball player that plays on the hometown courts and everyone's like, 'She's the best I ever played with." - Amy Poehler for IndieWire[^3]

We've thought about connections to each other, but now back to the initial question: how closely associated with SNL are these various collaborations? Who is working with each other on SNL projects, and those that are strongly connected?

Noticeably, [Paula Pell](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0996134/) has a relatively low SNL coefficient - xxx, which falls in the top half of all SNL alums. For those unfamiliar with Pell, she was a writer from 1995-2013, actively involved in the creation of characters like XX, YY, and ZZ.

Here is an example where the person coefficient fails to capture the extent of SNL-ness - surely no one would argue that Pell's contributions to the show don't match those with more screen time.[^2]
but where the media coefficient illuminates more for us. Out of Pell's xxx references in filmography, xxx of them qualified as "potential SNL", and xxx were "definitive SNL".

And some of her closest friends on the show - Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Ana Gasteyer, and Rachel Dratch - make up the most of the Pell's collaborations.[^3].

So maybe SNL isn't an old boys' club after all -
