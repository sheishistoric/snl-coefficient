In honor of a super-special episode of @nbcsnl coming tomorrow, @KathrineEsten and I are finally launching the SNL Coefficient! We tried to quantify just how SNL a particular piece of media is, based on the SNL cast & crew involved in the project (more on that here.)

We answer a few big questions: does Adam Sandler always cast *SNL* alums in his films? Which *SNL* feature films involve the most alumni? In which genres and media types are alumni working - comedy movies, or something else? Just how influential is Lorne Michaels to *SNL* cast's careers? And most importantly: is *Mean Girls* secretly an *SNL* feature film?

Check out our first round of visualizations and blog posts -  we're excited to see what questions people might have as they dig in! Neither of us are media scholars, but we haven't seen these particular questions about the impact of *SNL* on the comedy/media landscape answered before.

Special thanks to @terrainsvagues & my colleagues at @upennlib, and @pennpricelab for helping in this project!
