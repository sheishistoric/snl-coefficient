## The Paula Pell Factor: How Collaboration Affects Careers

"Paula's like the basketball player that plays on the hometown courts and everyone's like, 'She's the best I ever played with." - Amy Poehler for IndieWire[^3]

We've thought about connections to each other, but now back to the initial question: how closely associated with SNL are these various collaborations? Who is working with each other on SNL projects, and those that are strongly connected?

Noticeably, [Paula Pell](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0996134/) has a relatively low SNL coefficient - xxx, which falls in the top half of all SNL alums. For those unfamiliar with Pell, she was a writer from 1995-2013, actively involved in the creation of characters like XX, YY, and ZZ.

Here is an example where the person coefficient fails to capture the extent of SNL-ness - surely no one would argue that Pell's contributions to the show don't match those with more screen time.[^2]
but where the media coefficient illuminates more for us. Out of Pell's xxx references in filmography, xxx of them qualified as "potential SNL", and xxx were "definitive SNL".

And some of her closest friends on the show - Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Ana Gasteyer, and Rachel Dratch - make up the most of the Pell's collaborations.[^3].

So maybe SNL isn't an old boys' club after all -
