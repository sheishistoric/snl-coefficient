# Welcome to The SNL Coefficient


*And live from New York*... we may not be in New York, but we've taken advantage of the wealth of data about media and *Saturday Night Live* to build the *SNL* coefficient. On this site, we've shared our first round of observations and analysis of the data, and invite to you send us your questions. 

To navigate the site:

* In [*About the Project*](/about), learn about the two creators (Emily and Kathrine Esten) and the origins of the project.
* In [*Blog Archive*](/blog), see analyses we've completed so far, contextualized by additional research into *SNL* alumni careers. Additional visualizations can be found here.
* In [*Introducing the Coefficient*](/introduction), see our justification of the project and some background on the coefficient formula
* Our [*Media Coefficient Visualization*](/explorer) will take a few seconds to load, but explore the more than 4,000 media (movies, podcasts, television series, etc.) that include 2 or more *SNL* alum, ranked by *SNL* coefficient. 
* Our [*Alum Coefficient Visualization*](/person-explorer) allows you to view the coefficients of all *SNL* alum from every season, including writers and cast members. You can curate the list by season, role, and exclude Lorne Michaels.
