# About the Project

Our project takes the long-running variety sketch comedy show *Saturday Night Live* and considers its potential impact on media production (ie. films, television, podcasts, etc.) While not an individual, *Saturday Night Live* has functioned as a consistent entity in American entertainment as the longest-running sketch comedy show on American television, as well as the longest-running variety show in U.S. history. [^2] Much has written about *SNL* stars' success and fame, as well as the show's impact in the political realm, but less so on the cast's influence within the comedy industry. In order to focus on the potential impact of the show on media production, we have developed the *SNL* Coefficient, inspired by the concept of the Erd√∂s/Bacon numbers, but finding connections between pieces of media (ie. a film and *SNL*) rather than two professionals in the field. Through data visualization and analysis, we hope to get a better understanding of the influence of the show.

The code for this project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/snl-coefficient/repositories).
